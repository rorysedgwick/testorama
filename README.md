A beginner's introduction to beginning testing, for beginners.

Why am I writing this introduction?
  Things I think would have helped me from the very start. Countless introductory guides available on the world wide web but many assume some knowledge of testing already/decent level of javascript/quickly skip to more complex examples and bury the simple ones. Tend to freely use terminology that is not explained prior and may have never come across previously.
  
Purpose of testing: 
  Robustness of code
  Ensures intimate knowledge of exactly what code is really doing/what you want outcomes of your code to be (good planning)
  Predicting outputs of functions is easy when they are short but soon writing multi-line functions that makes it   harder to keep track of intended results/
  Often find it makes you look at your code differently and spot ways it will fail/not work as intended
  
  
Testing in its simplest form:
  Unit testing
  What does each individual function do
  
Multitude of test suites with varying syntax but core of test functionality is:
  asserting(make sure that) the outcome of a function is exactly what is expected

The assertion can cover almost any outcome of calling the function with various inputs, basic examples being: 
That the outcome will be an exact match of a string 
That the length of the return will be exactly x
That the function won't throw an error
That the function will return a value of a certain data type e.g. Array, String, Number
That the function *will* throw an error
A combination of these

Give it a shot yourself!
INSTALL NODE?
```npm install TEST SUITE```
```blah blah```
